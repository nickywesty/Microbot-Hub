# ü§ñ PVP RL Bot - Quick Start Guide

**AI-Powered PvP Bot for Old School RuneScape**

This plugin uses trained reinforcement learning models to automatically play PvP in OSRS. The AI was trained through 1000s of simulated fights and can handle NH-style combat including prayer switching, gear switches, eating, and special attacks.

```

```

**Color Meanings:**
- üî¥ **Red**: Critical actions (prayers, emergency eating)
- üü† **Orange**: High priority (offensive, special attacks)
- üü° **Yellow**: Medium priority (gear, attacks)
- ‚ö™ **Gray**: Low priority (movement)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Explained

### API Connection
- **API Host**: Should always be `127.0.0.1` (localhost)
- **API Port**: Must match the port in START_PVP_RL.bat (default: 8888)
- **Model Name**: The AI model to use (FineTunedNh is recommended)

### Feature Toggles
Turn features on/off to control what the AI can do:

- ‚úÖ **Enable Prayer Switching**: AI switches overhead prayers
- ‚úÖ **Enable Gear Switching**: AI changes equipment (limited support)
- ‚ùå **Enable Movement**: AI moves your character (DISABLED by default - can be risky!)
- ‚úÖ **Enable Attacking**: AI attacks targets
- ‚úÖ **Enable Eating**: AI eats food and drinks potions
- ‚úÖ **Enable Special Attack**: AI uses special attacks

### Safety Settings
- **Emergency Logout HP**: Auto-logout if HP drops below this (default: 20)

- **Require Target**: Only runs when you have a target (recommended: ON)
- **Max Actions Per Tick**: How many actions to execute per game tick (default: 12)

### Debug Options
- **Show Debug Overlay**: Display the stats overlay (recommended: ON)
- **Log Actions**: Print all actions to console (good for debugging)
- **Log Observations**: Print game state to console (very verbose!)
- **Tick Delay Multiplier**: Slow down the bot (1.0 = normal, 2.0 = half speed)

## üéØ Tips for Best Results

### 1. Start in LMS
- Safest place to test
- Free gear provided
- No risk of losing items
- Good opponents to train against

### 2. Use NH Gear
The AI was trained on NH (No Honor) style combat:
- **Melee**: Godsword, Dragon claws, Dragon dagger
- **Ranged**: Crossbow, Ballista, Dark bow
- **Mage**: Ancient spellbook (Ice Barrage, Blood Barrage)
- **Food**: Manta rays, Anglerfish, Karambwans
- **Potions**: Saradomin brews, Super restores

### 3. Watch the First Fight
- Don't walk away immediately
- Watch how the AI behaves
- Check for any errors in overlay
- Make sure prayers are switching

### 4. Adjust Settings
If the AI dies too often:
- Increase "Emergency Logout HP" to 40-50
- Disable risky features (movement, special attacks)
- Use tankier gear

If the AI is too passive:
- Make sure "Enable Attacking" is ON
- Check you have a target selected
- Enable "Log Actions" to see what it's doing

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### Problem: "API: DISCONNECTED" (Red)

**Cause**: Python API server isn't running

**Fix**:
1. Check if START_PVP_RL.bat is still open
2. If closed, double-click it again
3. Look for errors in the black window
4. Make sure port 8888 isn't used by another program

---

### Problem: Bot connects but doesn't do anything

**Cause**: Missing target or disabled features

**Fix**:
1. Make sure you're targeting an opponent (right-click ‚Üí Attack)
2. Check "Require Target" setting (if ON, you need a target)
3. Enable features: Attacking, Prayer Switching, Eating should all be ON
4. Check overlay - it should show "Target: [name]"

---

### Problem: Bot dies instantly

**Cause**: AI not defending properly

**Fix**:
1. Lower "Emergency Logout HP" to 40-50 (more cautious)
2. Make sure you have food in inventory
3. Check prayer points aren't 0
4. The AI was trained in simulation - real game is harder!
5. Try easier opponents first

---

### Problem: High latency (>500ms)

**Cause**: Slow API server or computer lag

**Fix**:
1. Close other programs
2. Restart START_PVP_RL.bat
3. Check your computer isn't under heavy load
4. The AI should respond in <100ms normally

---

### Problem: Actions not executing

**Cause**: Invalid actions or inventory issues

**Fix**:
1. Make sure you have food/potions in inventory
2. Check prayer points > 0
3. Enable "Log Actions" in config
4. Look for errors in Microbot console
