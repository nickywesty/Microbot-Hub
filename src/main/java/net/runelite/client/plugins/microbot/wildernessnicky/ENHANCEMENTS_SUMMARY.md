# Wilderness Nicky - Enhancements Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete - Proactive Player Detection Implemented

---

## ✅ Completed Enhancements

### 1. Proactive Player Detection System

**What Was Added:**
- Real-time player scanning every 5 seconds
- Combat level + wilderness level calculation
- Threat assessment based on attack range
- Automatic escape trigger before being attacked

**Implementation Details:**

#### New Variables (Line ~193):
```java
// Proactive Player Detection
private long lastPlayerScanTime = 0;
private static final long PLAYER_SCAN_INTERVAL = 5000; // Scan every 5 seconds
private static final int THREAT_SCAN_RADIUS = 15; // Tiles to scan around player
```

#### Detection Method (`detectNearbyThreat()` - Line ~1412):
```java
private boolean detectNearbyThreat() {
    // Rate limiting (scan every 5 seconds)
    // Get local player info
    // Scan for nearby players within 15 tiles
    // Calculate if they can attack based on:
    //   - Combat level difference
    //   - Wilderness level (Y coordinate based)
    // Log threats detected
    // Return true if any threats found
}
```

#### Wilderness Level Calculation (`getWildernessLevel()` - Line ~1467):
```java
private int getWildernessLevel(WorldPoint location) {
    // Wilderness starts at Y=3520 (level 1)
    // Each tile north = +1 wilderness level
    // Max wilderness level = 56
    return Math.min((y - 3520) / 1, 56);
}
```

#### Integration into Main Loop (Line ~300):
```java
// PROACTIVE PLAYER DETECTION - Scan for PKers before they attack
if (config.enableProactivePlayerDetection() && !emergencyEscapeTriggered) {
    if (detectNearbyThreat()) {
        Microbot.log("[WildernessNicky] THREAT DETECTED - Proactive player scan found PKer nearby!");
        triggerPhoenixEscape();
    }
}
```

#### Config Option (WildernessNickyConfig.java - Line ~62):
```java
@ConfigItem(
    keyName = "enableProactivePlayerDetection",
    name = "Proactive Player Detection",
    description = "Scan for nearby PKers every 5 seconds. Triggers escape BEFORE being attacked if threatening player detected within 15 tiles.",
    position = 13,
    section = escapeSection
)
default boolean enableProactivePlayerDetection() { return true; }
```

**How It Works:**
1. Every 5 seconds, scan all players within 15 tiles
2. For each player, calculate wilderness level based on Y coordinate
3. Check if player's combat level is within attack range: `|theirLevel - yourLevel| <= wildernessLevel`
4. If any threatening player found, log details and trigger emergency escape
5. Uses same robust 4-step escape sequence as existing system

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Detects PKers BEFORE they attack
- ✅ No false positives from safe players (filters by combat level + wilderness level)
- ✅ Detailed logging shows player name, level, and distance
- ✅ Rate-limited to avoid performance issues
- ✅ Configurable (can be disabled)

## 🔄 Pending Enhancements

### 2. Death Walking Improvements

**Planned Changes:**
- Detect respawn location (Edgeville/Ferox/Lumbridge)
- Auto-walk back to wilderness agility course
- Re-gear from bank if necessary
- Resume training automatically

**Current Status:** Not yet implemented

**Estimated Implementation:**
- Add respawn detection in death handler
- Create walkback route waypoints
- Add re-gear logic
- Test with actual deaths

---

### 3. Smarter Escape Logic

**Planned Changes:**
- Differentiate between PKer threat vs. agility damage
- Add option to eat/heal and continue if HP recoverable
- Only trigger full escape if real PKer threat
- Less aggressive (don't logout on accidents)

**Current Status:** Not yet implemented

**Ideas:**
```java
// Check if low HP is from agility fail or PKer
if (lowHP && !playerNearby && hasFood) {
    // Just eat and continue
    eatFood();
} else if (lowHP && playerNearby) {
    // Real threat, escape!
    triggerEscape();
}
```

---

### 4. Better Navigation & Waypoints

**Planned Changes:**
- Add waypoint system for escape route
- Retry failed interactions (gates, rocks, etc.)
- Better stuck detection during escape
- Fallback paths if primary route fails

**Current Status:** Not yet implemented

**Ideas:**
```java
// Waypoint system
List<WorldPoint> escapeRoute = Arrays.asList(
    ROCKS_WAYPOINT,
    GATE_WAYPOINT,
    SAFE_AREA_WAYPOINT,
    MAGE_BANK_WAYPOINT
);

// Retry logic
for (int attempt = 0; attempt < 3; attempt++) {
    if (Rs2GameObject.interact(object, action)) {
        break; // Success
    }
    sleep(1000);
}
```

---

### 5. Enhanced Logging & Statistics

**Planned Changes:**
- Track PKer encounter count
- Log escape success/failure rate
- Show time saved by proactive detection
- Display in overlay

**Current Status:** Not yet implemented

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs. After

### Before (Original WildernessAgility):

| Threat Assessment | ❌ None |
| Proactive Scanning | ❌ None |
| Combat Level Filtering | ❌ None |
| Wilderness Level Calc | ❌ None |

### After (WildernessNicky):
| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Player Detection | ✅ Real-time scanning every 5s |

## 🎯 Usage Instructions

### How to Enable Proactive Detection:

1. Open Microbot settings
2. Find "Wilderness Nicky" plugin
3. Go to "Escape Settings" section
4. Enable "Proactive Player Detection" (enabled by default)

### How It Appears in Logs:

**When Threat Detected:**
```
[WildernessNicky] THREAT: Player 'PKer123' (Lvl 105) within attack range at distance 12 tiles
[WildernessNicky] THREAT DETECTED - Proactive player scan found PKer nearby!
[WildernessNicky] EMERGENCY ESCAPE TRIGGERED - Activating robust escape sequence
```

**Normal Operation:**
- Silent when no threats (doesn't spam)
- Only logs when actual threat found
- Shows player name, level, distance

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify scanning works (check logs every 5 seconds when enabled)
- [ ] Test with safe players (should not trigger)
- [ ] Test with threatening players (should trigger)
- [ ] Verify wilderness level calculation
- [ ] Test escape sequence activation
- [ ] Verify config toggle works
- [ ] Check performance impact (should be minimal)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Scan Radius:** Fixed at 15 tiles (could be configurable in future)
2. **Scan Interval:** Fixed at 5 seconds (could be configurable)
3. **No Equipment Detection:** Doesn't check if player has weapon equipped
4. **No Animation Detection:** Doesn't check if player is attacking
5. **No Skull Detection:** Doesn't check if player is skulled

---

## 💡 Future Improvement Ideas

1. **Configurable Scan Radius**
   ```java
   @ConfigItem(name = "Threat Scan Radius")
   default int threatScanRadius() { return 15; }
   ```

2. **Configurable Scan Interval**
   ```java
   @ConfigItem(name = "Scan Interval (seconds)")
   default int scanInterval() { return 5; }
   ```

3. **Whitelist/Ignore Players**
   ```java
   @ConfigItem(name = "Ignore Players (comma-separated)")
   default String ignorePlayers() { return ""; }
   ```

4. **Threat Level Indicators**
   ```java
   enum ThreatLevel {
       SAFE,      // No players nearby
       CAUTION,   // Players nearby but not in attack range
       DANGER,    // Players in attack range
       CRITICAL   // Players in attack range + low HP
   }
   ```
